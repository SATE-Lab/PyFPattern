For color images, the last dimension specifies\n        the channel: a RGB image would have `n_channels=3`.\n\n    patch_size : tuple of ints (patch_height, patch_width)\n        the dimensions of one patch\n\n    max_patches : integer or float, optional default is None\n        The maximum number of patches to extract. If max_patches is a float\n        between 0 and 1, it is taken to be a proportion of the total number\n        of patches.\n\n    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)\n        Determines the random number generator used for random sampling when\n        `max_patches` is not None. Use an int to make the randomness\n        deterministic.\n        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    patches : array, shape = (n_patches, patch_height, patch_width) or\n        (n_patches, patch_height, patch_width, n_channels)\n        The collection of patches extracted from the image, where `n_patches`\n        is either `max_patches` or the total number of patches that can be\n        extracted.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> from sklearn.datasets import load_sample_image\n    >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction import image\n    >>> # Use the array data from the first image in this dataset:\n    >>> one_image = load_sample_image("china.jpg")\n    >>> print(\'Image shape: {}\'.format(one_image.shape))\n    Image shape: (427, 640, 3)\n    >>> patches = image.extract_patches_2d(one_image, (2, 2))\n    >>> print(\'Patches shape: {}\'.format(patches.shape))\n    Patches shape: (272214, 2, 2, 3)\n    >>> # Here are just two of these patches:\n    >>> print(patches[1])\n    [[[174 201 231]\n      [174 201 231]]\n     [[173 200 230]\n      [173 200 230]]]\n    >>> print(patches[800])\n    [[[187 214 243]\n      [188 215 244]]\n     [[187 214 243]\n      [188 215 244]]]\n    '
