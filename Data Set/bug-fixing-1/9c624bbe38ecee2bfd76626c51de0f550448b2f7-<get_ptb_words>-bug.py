def get_ptb_words():
    "Gets the Penn Tree Bank dataset as long word sequences.\n\n    `Penn Tree Bank <https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/>`_ is originally a\n    corpus of English sentences with linguistic structure annotations. This\n    function uses a variant distributed at\n    `https://github.com/wojzaremba/lstm <https://github.com/wojzaremba/lstm>`_,\n    which omits the annotation and splits the dataset into three parts:\n    training, validation, and test.\n\n    This function returns the training, validation, and test sets, each of\n    which is represented as a long array of word IDs. All sentences in the\n    dataset are concatenated by End-of-Sentence mark '<eos>', which is treated\n    as one of the vocabulary.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple of numpy.ndarray: Int32 vectors of word IDs.\n\n    .. Seealso::\n       Use :func:`get_ptb_words_vocabulary` to get the mapping between the\n       words and word IDs.\n\n    "
