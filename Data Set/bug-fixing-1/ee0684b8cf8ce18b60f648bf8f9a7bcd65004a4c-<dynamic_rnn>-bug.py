    'Creates a recurrent neural network specified by RNNCell "cell".\n\n  This function is functionally identical to the function `rnn` above, but\n  performs fully dynamic unrolling of `inputs`.\n\n  Unlike `rnn`, the input `inputs` is not a Python list of `Tensors`.  Instead,\n  it is a single `Tensor` where the maximum time is either the first or second\n  dimension (see the parameter `time_major`).  The corresponding output is\n  a single `Tensor` having the same number of time steps and batch size.\n\n  The parameter `sequence_length` is required and dynamic calculation is\n  automatically performed.\n\n  Args:\n    cell: An instance of RNNCell.\n    inputs: The RNN inputs.\n      If time_major == False (default), this must be a tensor of shape:\n        `[batch_size, max_time, input_size]`.\n      If time_major == True, this must be a tensor of shape:\n        `[max_time, batch_size, input_size]`.\n    sequence_length: (optional) An int32/int64 vector sized `[batch_size]`.\n    initial_state: (optional) An initial state for the RNN.  This must be\n      a tensor of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size x cell.state_size]`.\n    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state.  Required if\n      initial_state is not provided.\n    parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in\n      parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency\n      and can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off\n      time for space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time,\n      while smaller values use less memory but computations take longer.\n    swap_memory: Swap the tensors produced in forward inference but needed\n      for back prop from GPU to CPU.\n    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` Tensors.\n      If true, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`.\n      If false, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`.\n      Using time_major = False is a bit more efficient because it avoids\n      transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However,\n      most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function\n      accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.\n    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "RNN".\n\n  Returns:\n    A pair (outputs, state) where:\n      outputs: The RNN output `Tensor`.\n        If time_major == False (default), this will be a `Tensor` shaped:\n          `[batch_size, max_time, cell.output_size]`.\n        If time_major == True, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:\n          `[max_time, batch_size, cell.output_size]`.\n      state: The final state, shaped:\n        `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.\n\n  Raises:\n    TypeError: If "cell" is not an instance of RNNCell.\n    ValueError: If inputs is None or an empty list.\n  '
