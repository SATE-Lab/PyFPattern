    '\n    Calculate the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n\n    The Wilcoxon signed-rank test tests the null hypothesis that two\n    related paired samples come from the same distribution. In particular,\n    it tests whether the distribution of the differences x - y is symmetric\n    about zero. It is a non-parametric version of the paired T-test.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : array_like\n        Either the first set of measurements (in which case `y` is the second\n        set of measurements), or the differences between two sets of\n        measurements (in which case `y` is not to be specified.)  Must be\n        one-dimensional.\n    y : array_like, optional\n        Either the second set of measurements (if `x` is the first set of\n        measurements), or not specified (if `x` is the differences between\n        two sets of measurements.)  Must be one-dimensional.\n    zero_method : {"pratt", "wilcox", "zsplit"}, optional. Default is "wilcox".\n        "pratt":\n            includes zero-differences in the ranking process,\n            but drops the ranks of the zeros, see [4]_, (more conservative)\n        "wilcox":\n            discards all zero-differences, the default\n        "zsplit":\n            includes zero-differences in the ranking process and split the\n            zero rank between positive and negative ones\n    correction : bool, optional\n        If True, apply continuity correction by adjusting the Wilcoxon rank\n        statistic by 0.5 towards the mean value when computing the\n        z-statistic.  Default is False.\n    alternative : {"two-sided", "greater", "less"}, optional\n        The alternative hypothesis to be tested, see Notes. Default is\n        "two-sided".\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    statistic : float\n        If `alternative` is "two-sided", the sum of the ranks of the\n        differences above or below zero, whichever is smaller.\n        Otherwise the sum of the ranks of the differences above zero.\n    pvalue : float\n        The p-value for the test depending on `alternative`.\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    kruskal, mannwhitneyu\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    The test has been introduced in [4]_. Given n independent samples\n    (xi, yi) from a bivariate distribution (i.e. paired samples),\n    it computes the differences di = xi - yi. One assumption of the test\n    is that the differences are symmetric, see [2]_.\n    The two-sided test has the null hypothesis that the median of the\n    differences is zero against the alternative that it is different from\n    zero. The one-sided test has the null that the median is positive against\n    the alternative that the it is negative (``alternative == \'less\'``),\n    or vice versa (``alternative == \'greater.\'``).\n\n    The test uses a normal approximation to derive the p-value (if\n    ``zero_method == \'pratt\'``, the approximation is adjusted as in [5]_).\n    A typical rule is to require that n > 20 ([2]_, p. 383). For smaller n,\n    exact tables can be used to find critical values.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    .. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test\n    ..

To test the null\n    hypothesis that there is no height difference, we can apply the\n    two-sided test:\n\n    >>> from scipy.stats import wilcoxon\n    >>> w, p = wilcoxon(d)\n    >>> w, p\n    (24.0, 0.04088813291185591)\n\n    Hence, we would reject the null hypothesis at a confidence level of 5%,\n    concluding that there is a difference in height between the groups.\n    To confirm that the median of the differences can be assumed to be\n    positive, we use:\n\n    >>> w, p = wilcoxon(d, alternative=\'greater\')\n    >>> w, p\n    (96.0, 0.020444066455927955)\n\n    This shows that the null hypothesis that the median is negative can be\n    rejected at a confidence level of 5% in favor of the alternative that\n    the median is greater than zero. The p-value based on the approximation\n    is within the range of 0.019 and 0.054 given in [2]_.\n    Note that the statistic changed to 96 in the one-sided case (the sum\n    of ranks of positive differences) whereas it is 24 in the two-sided\n    case (the minimum of sum of ranks above and below zero).\n\n    '
