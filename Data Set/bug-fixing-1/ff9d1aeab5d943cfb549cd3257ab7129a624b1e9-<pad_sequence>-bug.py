    "Pad a list of variable length Variables with zero\n\n    ``pad_sequence`` stacks a list of Variables along a new dimension,\n    and padds them to equal length.

It's equal to the number of elements in ``sequences``.\n    T is length longest sequence.\n    L is length of the sequence.\n    * is any number of trailing dimensions, including none.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence\n        >>> a = Variable(torch.ones(25, 300))\n        >>> b = Variable(torch.ones(22, 300))\n        >>> c = Variable(torch.ones(15, 300))\n        >>> pad_sequence([a, b, c]).size()\n        torch.Size([25, 3, 300])\n\n    Note:\n        This function returns a Variable of size TxBx* or BxTx* where T is the\n            length of longest sequence.\n        Function assumes trailing dimensions and type of all the Variables\n            in sequences are same.\n\n    Arguments:\n        sequences (list[Variable]): list of variable length sequences.\n        batch_first (bool, optional): output will be in BxTx* if True, or in\n            TxBx* otherwise\n\n    Returns:\n        Variable of size ``T x B x * `` if batch_first is False\n        Variable of size ``B x T x * `` otherwise\n    "
