Please note that the\n        column indices of this SparseTensor must match the model column feature\n        indexing while the row indices are ignored.

If None\n        then 1.0 is used. This can be either a scaler or a rank-1 tensor with\n        the number of elements matching the number of rows to be projected.\n        Note that the column weights will be determined by the underlying WALS\n        model.\n\n    Returns:\n      Projected row factors.\n    '
