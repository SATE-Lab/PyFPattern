If there are no\n    collisions, then this returns None.\n\n    If you don\'t need all the features of the spritecollide function, this\n    function will be a bit quicker.\n\n    Collided is a callback function used to calculate if two sprites are\n    colliding. It should take two sprites as values and return a bool value\n    indicating if they are colliding. If collided is not passed, then all\n    sprites must have a "rect" value, which is a rectangle of the sprite area,\n    which will be used to calculate the collision.\n\n\n    '
