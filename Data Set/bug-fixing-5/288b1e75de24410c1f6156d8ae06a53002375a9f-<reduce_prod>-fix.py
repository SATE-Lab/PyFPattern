If\n            :attr:`None`, multipy all elements of :attr:`input` and return a\n            Tensor variable with a single element, otherwise must be in the\n            range :math:`[-rank(input), rank(input))`. If :math:`dim[i] < 0`,\n            the dimension to reduce is :math:`rank + dim[i]`.\n        keep_dim (bool, optional): Whether to reserve the reduced dimension in the\n            output Tensor.
