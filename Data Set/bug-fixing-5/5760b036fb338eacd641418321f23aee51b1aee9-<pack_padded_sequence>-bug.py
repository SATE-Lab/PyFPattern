If ``batch_first`` is True ``BxTx*`` inputs are\n    expected.\n\n    The sequences should be sorted by length in a decreasing order, i.e.\n    ``input[:,0]`` should be the longest sequence, and ``input[:,B-1]`` the\n    shortest one.\n\n    Note:\n        This function accept any input that has at least two dimensions. You\n        can apply it to pack the labels, and use the output of the RNN with\n        them to compute the loss directly. A Variable can be retrieved from\n        a :class:`PackedSequence` object by accessing its ``.data`` attribute.\n\n    Arguments:\n        input (Variable): padded batch of variable length sequences.\n        lengths (list[int]): list of sequences lengths of each batch element.\n        batch_first (bool, optional): if True, the input is expected in BxTx*\n            format.\n\n    Returns:\n        a :class:`PackedSequence` object\n    '
