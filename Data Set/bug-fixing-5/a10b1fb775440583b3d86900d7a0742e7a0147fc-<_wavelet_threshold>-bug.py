    'Perform wavelet denoising.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    img : ndarray (2d or 3d) of ints, uints or floats\n        Input data to be denoised. `img` can be of any numeric type,\n        but it is cast into an ndarray of floats for the computation\n        of the denoised image.\n    wavelet : string\n        The type of wavelet to perform. Can be any of the options\n        pywt.wavelist outputs. For example, this may be any of ``{db1, db2,\n        db3, db4, haar}``.\n    sigma : float, optional\n        The standard deviation of the noise. The noise is estimated when sigma\n        is None (the default) by the method in [2]_.\n    threshold : float, optional\n        The thresholding value. All wavelet coefficients less than this value\n        are set to 0. The default value (None) uses the BayesShrink method\n        found in [1]_ to remove noise.\n    mode : {\'soft\', \'hard\'}, optional\n        An optional argument to choose the type of denoising performed. It\n        noted that choosing soft thresholding given additive noise finds the\n        best approximation of the original image.\n    wavelet_levels : int or None, optional\n        The number of wavelet decomposition levels to use.  The default is\n        three less than the maximum number of possible decomposition levels\n        (see Notes below).\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    out : ndarray\n        Denoised image.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Reference [1]_ used four levels of wavelet decomposition.  To be more\n    flexible for a range of input sizes, the implementation here stops 3 levels\n    prior to the maximum level of decomposition for `img` (the exact # of\n    levels thus depends on `img.shape` and the chosen wavelet). BayesShrink\n    variance estimation doesn\'t work well on levels with extremely small\n    coefficient arrays.  This is the rationale for skipping a few of the\n    coarsest levels.  The user can override the automated setting by explicitly\n    specifying `wavelet_levels`.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    .. [1] Chang, S. Grace, Bin Yu, and Martin Vetterli.
