def save_parameters(self, filename):
    'Save parameters to file.\n        This function is to be used to save parameters of a Gluon model, note that\n        the saved parameters are not meant to be loaded in a different language binding for now.\n        Saving parameters using `.save_parameters()` is different than\n        `.collect_params().save()` and `.save_params()`, which are deprecated ways\n        to save the parameters of a model and should be avoided.\n\n        If your model is hybridizable and you want to export a serialized version of the\n        structure of the model as well as its parameters please refer to\n        :py:meth:`HybridBlock.export`. Such model can then be loaded back in any language binding\n        or even in Gluon using a :py:class:`SymbolBlock`.\n        Refer to this tutorial for a complete overview of saving/loading models with\n        MXNet: https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/gluon/save_load_params.html\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        filename : str\n            Path to file.\n        '
