def vectorstrength(events, period):
    '\n    Determine the vector strength of the events corresponding to the given\n    period.\n\n    The vector strength is a measure of phase synchrony, how well the\n    timing of the events is synchronized to a single period of a periodic\n    signal.\n\n    If multiple periods are used, calculate the vector strength of each.\n    This is called the "resonating vector strength".\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    events : 1D array_like\n        An array of time points containing the timing of the events.\n    period : float or array_like\n        The period of the signal that the events should synchronize to.\n        The period is in the same units as `events`.  It can also be an array\n        of periods, in which case the outputs are arrays of the same length.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    strength : float or 1D array\n        The strength of the synchronization.  1.0 is perfect synchronization\n        and 0.0 is no synchronization.  If `period` is an array, this is also\n        an array with each element containing the vector strength at the\n        corresponding period.\n    phase : float or array\n        The phase that the events are most strongly synchronized to in radians.\n        If `period` is an array, this is also an array with each element\n        containing the phase for the corresponding period.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    van Hemmen, JL, Longtin, A, and Vollmayr, AN.
