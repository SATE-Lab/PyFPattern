Thus, for r == 0, indicating no\n    serial correlation, the test statistic equals 2. This statistic will\n    always be between 0 and 4. The closer to 0 the statistic, the more\n    evidence for positive serial correlation. The closer to 4, the more\n    evidence for negative serial correlation.\n    '
