    '\n    Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    a : array_like\n        Array containing data to be averaged. If `a` is not an array, a\n        conversion is attempted.\n    axis : int, optional\n        Axis along which to average `a`. If `None`, averaging is done over\n        the flattened array.\n    weights : array_like, optional\n        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in\n        `a` contributes to the average according to its associated weight.\n        The weights array can either be 1-D (in which case its length must be\n        the size of `a` along the given axis) or of the same shape as `a`.\n        If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a\n        weight equal to one.\n    returned : bool, optional\n        Default is `False`. If `True`, the tuple (`average`, `sum_of_weights`)\n        is returned, otherwise only the average is returned.\n        If `weights=None`, `sum_of_weights` is equivalent to the number of\n        elements over which the average is taken.\n\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    average, [sum_of_weights] : array_type or double\n        Return the average along the specified axis. When returned is `True`,\n        return a tuple with the average as the first element and the sum\n        of the weights as the second element. The return type is `Float`\n        if `a` is of integer type, otherwise it is of the same type as `a`.\n        `sum_of_weights` is of the same type as `average`.\n\n    Raises\n    ------\n    ZeroDivisionError\n        When all weights along axis are zero.
