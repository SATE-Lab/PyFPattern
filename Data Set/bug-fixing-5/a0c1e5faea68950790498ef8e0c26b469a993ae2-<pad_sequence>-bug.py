def pad_sequence(sequences, batch_first=False, padding_value=0):
    "Pad a list of variable length Tensors with zero\n\n    ``pad_sequence`` stacks a list of Tensors along a new dimension,\n    and padds them to equal length. For example, if the input is list of\n    sequences with size ``L x *`` and if batch_first is False, and ``T x B x *``\n    otherwise. The list of sequences should be sorted in the order of\n    decreasing length.\n\n    `B` is batch size. It's equal to the number of elements in ``sequences``.\n    `T` is length of the longest sequence.\n    `L` is length of the sequence.\n    `*` is any number of trailing dimensions, including none.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence\n        >>> a = torch.ones(25, 300)\n        >>> b = torch.ones(22, 300)\n        >>> c = torch.ones(15, 300)\n        >>> pad_sequence([a, b, c]).size()\n        torch.Size([25, 3, 300])\n\n    Note:\n        This function returns a Tensor of size ``T x B x *`` or ``B x T x *`` where `T` is the\n            length of longest sequence.\n        Function assumes trailing dimensions and type of all the Tensors\n            in sequences are same.\n\n    Arguments:\n        sequences (list[Tensor]): list of variable length sequences.\n        batch_first (bool, optional): output will be in ``B x T x *`` if True, or in\n            ``T x B x *`` otherwise\n        padding_value (float, optional): value for padded elements.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor of size ``T x B x *`` if batch_first is False\n        Tensor of size ``B x T x *`` otherwise\n    "
