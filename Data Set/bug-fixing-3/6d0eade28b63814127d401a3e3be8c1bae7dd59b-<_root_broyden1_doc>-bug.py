    "\n    Options\n    -------\n    nit : int, optional\n        Number of iterations to make. If omitted (default), make as many\n        as required to meet tolerances.\n    disp : bool, optional\n        Print status to stdout on every iteration.\n    maxiter : int, optional\n        Maximum number of iterations to make. If more are needed to\n        meet convergence, `NoConvergence` is raised.\n    ftol : float, optional\n        Relative tolerance for the residual. If omitted, not used.\n    fatol : float, optional\n        Absolute tolerance (in max-norm) for the residual.\n        If omitted, default is 6e-6.\n    xtol : float, optional\n        Relative minimum step size. If omitted, not used.\n    xatol : float, optional\n        Absolute minimum step size, as determined from the Jacobian\n        approximation. If the step size is smaller than this, optimization\n        is terminated as successful. If omitted, not used.\n    tol_norm : function(vector) -> scalar, optional\n        Norm to use in convergence check. Default is the maximum norm.\n    line_search : {None, 'armijo' (default), 'wolfe'}, optional\n        Which type of a line search to use to determine the step size in\n        the direction given by the Jacobian approximation. Defaults to\n        'armijo'.\n    jac_options : dict, optional\n        Options for the respective Jacobian approximation.\n            alpha : float, optional\n                Initial guess for the Jacobian is (-1/alpha).\n            reduction_method : str or tuple, optional\n                Method used in ensuring that the rank of the Broyden\n                matrix stays low. Can either be a string giving the\n                name of the method, or a tuple of the form ``(method,\n                param1, param2, ...)`` that gives the name of the\n                method and values for additional parameters.\n\n                Methods available:\n                    - ``restart``: drop all matrix columns. Has no\n                        extra parameters.\n                    - ``simple``: drop oldest matrix column. Has no\n                        extra parameters.\n                    - ``svd``: keep only the most significant SVD\n                        components.\n                      Extra parameters:\n                          - ``to_retain``: number of SVD components to\n                              retain when rank reduction is done.\n                              Default is ``max_rank - 2``.\n            max_rank : int, optional\n                Maximum rank for the Broyden matrix.\n                Default is infinity (ie., no rank reduction).\n    "
