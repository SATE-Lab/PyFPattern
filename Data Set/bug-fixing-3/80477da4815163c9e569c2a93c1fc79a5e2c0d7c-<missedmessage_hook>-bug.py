    "The receiver_is_off_zulip logic used to determine whether a user\n    has no active client suffers from a somewhat fundamental race\n    condition.  If the client is no longer on the Internet,\n    receiver_is_off_zulip will still return true for\n    IDLE_EVENT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_SECS, until the queue is\n    garbage-collected.  This would cause us to reliably miss\n    push/email notifying users for messages arriving during the\n    IDLE_EVENT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_SECS after they suspend their laptop (for\n    example).  We address this by, when the queue is garbage-collected\n    at the end of those 10 minutes, checking to see if it's the last\n    one, and if so, potentially triggering notifications to the user\n    at that time, resulting in at most a IDLE_EVENT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_SECS\n    delay in the arrival of their notifications.\n\n    As Zulip's APIs get more popular and the mobile apps start using\n    long-lived event queues for perf optimization, future versions of\n    this will likely need to replace checking `last_for_client` with\n    something more complicated, so that we only consider clients like\n    web browsers, not the mobile apps or random API scripts.\n    "
